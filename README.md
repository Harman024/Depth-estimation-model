# Depth-estimation-model
First run callibration.ipynb file to get the focal lenght and other camera parameters of your device.

Then take 2 stereo images such that you know the distance d between the stereo cameras.

Run Image registration to combine the left and right stereo images.

At last run the Stereo depth solution to get the find the depth of objects in the image using depth-disparity concept with combined image.
